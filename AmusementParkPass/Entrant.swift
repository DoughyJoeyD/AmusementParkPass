/*

 This project is broken down into Entrants, Passes, PassChecker(Swipe), and test class
 
 A Visitor to the park is either a Entrant (Child, Vip, Classic) or an Employee(HourlyMaint, HourlyRide, HourlyFood, Manager)
 Passes are created for ever Visitor, RegPasses for Entrants and EmpPasses for Employees
 The pass checker is also divided the same way the passes classes are (EmpPassChecker and RegularPassChecker)
 There is a test class for each of the Employees demontrating catching erorrs thrown from not including personal info)
 There are also test classes for the Entrants catching errors thrown by not having a dob(child).
 Protocols Define the Class types and enums define error types, park areas and discount types as well as EntrantTypes.
